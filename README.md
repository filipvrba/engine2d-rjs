## 1 Usage
It is possible to embed this engine in an *HTML* script.
It is necessary to access already-generated files.
Using a public page on github, this repository is hosted.
By doing this, it will be possible to make sure that
all created files are accessible at *https://filipvrba.github.io/engine2d-rjs/*.
You must directly read the provided file for it to operate correctly.

*The JS file can be accessed at this URL:*
```txt
https://filipvrba.github.io/engine2d-rjs/public/engine/js/engine2d_22a1215.js
```

## 2 Development
This project is being developed using [**RubyJS-Vite**](https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js),
which creates unified files. From "*src*" folders, these unified files are created.
All of the scripts will be combined by the [**RubyJS-Vite**](https://github.com/filipvrba/ruby-js) tool,
which will then generate itself under the name
"*engine2d*" *(and add the tag date)* to the "*docs/public/engine*" folder. 

> ### Info
> You can select the script you want to access from here.
> There are *JS* and *RJS* files available.
